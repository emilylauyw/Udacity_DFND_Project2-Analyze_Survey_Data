# Udacity DFND Project2 - Analyze Survey Data
Udacity Data Foundation Nanodegree Project 02 - Analyze Survey Data

## Description
In this project, I analyze a real dataset about current Udacity students across a number of programs. The dataset is a little messy (some things are input incorrectly, others are missing) and to decide how to analyze the data and then communicate my findings about it.
